- Add the following rule `0 2 * * Mon bash /opt/letsencryptrenewal/letsencryptrenewal.sh`<br>
  which means update every Monday at 2 am (server time)

| Minutes | Hour | Day of Month | Month | Day of Week | Command |
| ------- | ---- | ------------ | ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| 0       | 2    | *            | *     | Mon         | bash /opt/letsencryptrenewal/letsencryptrenewal.sh |

## Create new Certificates
- `/opt/letsencrypt/certbot-auto certonly`
- Follow the instructions

The new certificates will automatically be renewed.

## Logs
Default log file can be found at `/var/log/letsencryptrenewal.log`<br>
Log location can be changed in the script.

## Troubleshooting
The script is written using the default location of the letsencrypt package `/opt/letsencrypt`<br>
If Let's Encrypt is situated at another location you can change it to the right location in the script.
